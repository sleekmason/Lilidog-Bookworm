## Directions for changing the menu from jgmenu to openbox ##

If you choose to change over to using the openbox menu, 
you can simply backup the existing rc.xml, and then change 
the name of rc.xml-original.bak to rc.xml.

Please note that you will need to adjust the menu.xml 
by editing the file, as no menu editor exists anymore.

To check out the current openbox menu, try 'Ctl +Alt + q'
