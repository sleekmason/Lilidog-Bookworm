Apt Notifier - Changes the color of the 'plus' icon in
the tint2 panel when updates are available through apt. 

*NOTE - MANUAL METHOD
You can check if you have updates by clicking the plus
icon -> Check For Updates, which gives a notification
message and places an icon in the tray as a reminder
until exited if updates are available.

AUTO METHOD
For automatic notifications with a groovy icon color
change to boot, read on.

TO USE THE ICON COLOR CHANGER:
Click the Color Icon button on or off to allow the icon 
to change color whenever updates are available. If left 
enabled, the 'Plus' symbol in tint2 will change color 
whenever there are updates available, and then change 
back when all updates are completed. 

You can also choose from one of six update colors when
the icon is active.

*NOTE - If nothing changes when toggled on, then no 
updates are currently available, and you will simply 
have to wait for the groovy icon change.

For updates, click the plus icon and choose Apt Update.

EXECUTOR:
The tint2 executor time interval is currently set to 60
seconds.  This affects the update time for icon color
after performing an update. Feel free to change to say,
3600 seconds or greater if desired.  It will just take 
longer to change back to the regular icon color after 
an update.

TO TEST:
type 'apt list --upgradeable' in a terminal. If you get 
any listings, the icon should change color.

MORE INFO:
The apt notifier uses 'apt list --upgradeable' to check 
for upgradable packages, changing the color of the plus 
icon to show that updates are available. This is done
by enabling periodic updates in apt.

The notifier is a tint2 executable rather than a button, 
and the code gets changed on the fly in order to enable 
and disable the notifier, and change the icon color.
