Apt Notifier - Changes the color of the 'plus' icon in
the tint2 panel when updates are available through apt. 

TO USE:

Toggle the notifier on or off at will. Can be used two 
ways. If left enabled, the 'Plus' symbol in tint2 will 
change color whenever there are updates available. You 
can also choose from one of six update colors for when 
the icon is active.

*NOTE - If nothing changes when toggled on, then no 
updates are currently available, and you will simply 
have to wait for the groovy icon change.

Another way is to use the notifier as an toggle check. 
Toggle on the notifier and if the 'plus' icon changes 
color, then there are updates available.

For updates, click the plus icon and choose Apt Update.

TO TEST:

type 'apt list --upgradeable' in a terminal. If you get 
any listings, the icon should change color.

MORE INFO:

The apt notifier uses 'apt list --upgradeable' to check 
for upgradable packages, changing the color of the plus 
icon to show that updates are available. This is done
by enabling periodic updates in apt.

The notifier is a tint2 executable rather than a button, 
and the code gets changed on the fly in order to enable 
and disable the notifier, and change the icon color.
