Instructions for use of .desktop files for use on login automatically.

If installed:
To set up Maestral or Dropbox with a 12 second delay to not conflict
with the initialization of networking, copy one of the existing
.desktop file from /usr/share/Lilidog/extras/desktop-files.

After copying the file(s), reboot to have the program start on login.

For Dropbox: in a terminal, enter:
cp /usr/share/lilidog/autostart/dropbox.desktop ~/.config/autostart

For Maestral: in a terminal, enter:
cp /usr/share/lilidog/autostart/maestral.desktop ~/.config/autostart

Adjust these files as necessary.
