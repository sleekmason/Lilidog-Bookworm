Instructions for use of .desktop files for use on login automatically.

If installed:

For Maestral & dropbox, there is an option in 'preferences' to have
them start on login. If these fail to work properly uncheck the box 
and consider using one of the below files instead.

To start Maestral or Dropbox with a 12 sec. delay in case of conflict
with the initialization of networking, copy one of the existing
.desktop file from /usr/share/Lilidog/extras/desktop-files.

After copying the file(s), reboot to have the program start on login.

For Dropbox: in a terminal, enter:
cp /usr/share/lilidog/autostart/dropbox.desktop ~/.config/autostart

For Maestral: in a terminal, enter:
cp /usr/share/lilidog/autostart/maestral.desktop ~/.config/autostart

Adjust these .desktop files as desired.

.desktop files can be copied from /usr/share/applications, and placed 
here in ~/.config/ayutostart to start most programs installed with apt.
  
You can also make your own .desktop file if it doesn't yet exist.

Basic example, this one for dropbox:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Dropbox
Type=Application
Exec=sh -c "sleep 12 && ~/.local/share/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd"
Terminal=false
Icon=web-browser
Comment=Dropbox
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true

Definitions:

- Name - identifying word for the program used.
- Type - is it an application or something else?
- Exec - How you would call the program from a terminal. (hint hint)
- Terminal - Enter 'true' here if it is a terminal application.
- Icon - What icon do you wish to use for identification?
- Comment - What is the program about?
- X-GNOME-autostart-enabled - May or may not be necessary.

Notice the full $PATH used in calling dropbox in a .desktop file.  
This is good practice and ensures the program will be called correctly.
