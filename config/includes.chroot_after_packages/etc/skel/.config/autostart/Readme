Instructions for use of .desktop files for use on login automatically.

If installed:

For Maestral & dropbox, there is an option in 'preferences' to have
them start on login. If these fail to work properly uncheck the box 
and consider using one of the below files instead.

To start Maestral or Dropbox with a 12 sec. delay in case of conflict
with the initialization of networking, copy one of the existing
.desktop file from /usr/share/Lilidog/extras/desktop-files.

After copying the file(s), reboot to have the program start on login.

For Dropbox: in a terminal, enter:
cp /usr/share/lilidog/autostart/dropbox.desktop ~/.config/autostart

For Maestral: in a terminal, enter:
cp /usr/share/lilidog/autostart/maestral.desktop ~/.config/autostart

Adjust these .desktop files as desired.
