### TO CHANGE MENU ITEMS
There is currently no gui menu editor for jgmenu or Openbox. So:

Open the prepend.csv file to add/remove items in the menu.  
The format example is: Display-name, program-name, icon-name
See the other entries for examples.

All newly installed programs are still available through the "Debian" 
menu if you don't want to edit after installing a program. This menu
is left in place to ensure easy access to any programs installed.


### TO CHANGE THEMES WITHIN THE LILIDOG THEME CHANGER (Tint2 or menu.)
You can choose between the currently activated GTK or Openbox theme.
The easiest method is to edit any of the configuration files at:
 ~/.config/lilidog-themes and comment/uncomment the method you want
to use with any particular theme. 

### TO CHANGE THEMES WITHIN THE JGMENU INTERACTIVE PROMPT
You can choose between the currently activated GTK or Openbox theme.
Type 'jgmenu-interactive' in a terminal to open an interactive prompt.
Use  "o" or "g" to change to either the openbox or gtk theme colors.
DO NOT change any other settings here unless willing to experiment.


### TO CHANGE ICONS
Look in either the "paw" in the tint2 panel or the toggles menu for 
the jgmenu icon changer.


'man jgmenu' in a terminal for more info!
