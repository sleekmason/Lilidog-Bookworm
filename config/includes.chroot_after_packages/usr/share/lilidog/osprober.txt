    with grub to provide a list at boot of all the 
    systems enabled by grub on your computer.   
    
    Use the Toggle button to switch osprober on or 
    off. The log is in /var/log/grub-update.log
    
    Please wait for grub to finish updating before 
    rebooting. Look for the progress update dialog
    to disappear upon completion.
